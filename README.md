# DensityofStatesVASP
These scripts take the DOSCAR file generated from a VASP calculation and creates the data files necessary to plot the TDOS and PDOS for a given system. Keep in mind these were written for a 96 atom uranium dioxide supercell.

Honestly, it is best to use vaspkit or sumo to plot the density of states for collinear calculations.
